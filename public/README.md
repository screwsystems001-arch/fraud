# Public Assets

Place your logo file here as `logo.png`.

## Logo Requirements:
- **File name**: `logo.png` (or update the path in Navigation.tsx and Footer.tsx)
- **Recommended size**: Square format (e.g., 512x512 pixels) for circular display
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (recommended) or JPG
- **Location**: Place the file directly in this `public` folder
- **Shape**: The logo will be displayed as a circle with blue borders matching the website theme

## Favicon:
- The same `logo.png` file is used as the favicon
- For best results, ensure your logo is square and works well in a circular format
- The favicon will appear in browser tabs

## Current Setup:
The logo will automatically appear in:
- Navigation bar (top of the page) - circular with blue border
- Footer section - circular with blue border
- Contact page header - circular with blue border
- About page header - circular with blue border
- Courses page header - circular with blue border

If the logo file is not found, the text "Screw Systems" will be displayed as a fallback.
